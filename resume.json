			"description": "Continued delivering solutions using the Azure platform and DevOps best practices. Scoped and designed the architecture and the security posture for new pieces of work. Shifted into a leadership role, independently ran projects and managed team members across multiple disciplines to ensure that deliverables were on time and met the requirements. Heavily involved in the onboarding, including performing inductions for engineering staff both inside and outside of the software engineering discipline, and ensuring that new-hires were set up for success. Learned and practiced candidate evaluation skills for technical hires, gained practical experience with pre/post-interview tasks. Undertook training to further develop leadership and coaching skills, so that difference approaches could be used to meet different needs. Developed content for team standards, style guides, templates, and onboarding collateral to ensure that a standardized approach was taken to building solutions. Demonstrated flexibility and acquired new skills in the data platform space by working outside of my core role for an extended period of time. Gave back to the development community by contributing code to open-source projects and answering questions on developer forums.",
			"highlights": [
				"Created a data platform solution - Worked with a data platform engineer and the client to design and deliver a data lake and associated pipelines to ingest and reconcile data for a major transportation hub on a daily basis. This reporting data store replaced a legacy on-premises store with one hosted in Azure which was faster, more reliable, cheaper, and more accurate. Introduced new tools to the team that were instrumental in demonstrating milestones had been achieved, and sharing knowledge across the team.",
				"Developed an integration solution using streaming architecture - Created two streaming pipelines to handle different  scenarios for the same client. One for ingesting changes from an on-premises SQL Server database into an Azure SQL database in near realtime. The second used a serverless approach for receiving different events from an online store, validating their schema, and passing them on to an existing customer endpoint. Both of these pipelines were engineered in a way that allowed them to be easily extended to handle additional tables and event types.",
				"Built an online quiz application - Delivered a solution that was used as part of an event with teams in 40 locations throughout Australia and New Zealand. This project included tight deadlines, strict requirements - including supporting an interface mode allowed the TV production company to overlay the questions and correct answers over the video stream of the quiz master as part of a live stream, hardware integration with controllers, and creating documentation on how each station needed to be set up.",
				"Delivered an Internet of Things (IoT) platform - Integrated third-party devices with Azure IoT Hub and configured a lambda architecture for event storage for a major telecommunications company. In a technical leadership capacity, advised the client and internal staff on cloud and IoT best practices. Created a readily-extensible framework to allow for the integration of devices from other vendors and reporting on device behaviour. Set up serverless APIs to allow developer access to device information and telemetry data that had been ingested. Created Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) templates to ensure that consistency between environments and that future environments could be easily created.",
				"Heavily involved in development of workshop materials - Created technical content and exemplars for attendees to work through as part of Microsoft funded two day events. This content was the core focus of an on-going series of events throughout Asia-Pacific that are run remotely to educate the community on Microsoft product and workflows; such as DevOps and GitHub or Deploying Open-Source Software and tools on Azure. Reviewed, tested, and oversaw the development of content packs created by others."

				"Planned and delivered customer workshops - Successfully led multi-day workshops and events for customers. Operated as the sole presenter for company-specific events and collaborated as part of a team of coaches at events that were open to the public. These events covered a variety of topics and technologies, which could span multiple disciplines. This involved designing, writing, reviewing, and testing event content practical exercises; usually on short notice, with limited preparation time, and occasionally for others to deliver.",
				"Developed an Automated Ad Serving solution - Successfully architected and delivered a project, using a new language and unfamiliar technologies. Interacted directly with technical and non-technical staff on the client-side to; confirm requirements, prevent scope creep, sign-off milestones, and exceed client expectations. The end deliverable significantly improved the client’s go-live process, provided increased visibility of changes, and is readily extensible.",
				"Championed team improvements - Designed and implements a pull request template for a frequently changing repository. Regularly shared development of new tools, functionality, productivity tips, and other announcements with team members to encourage continuous improvement. Created and shared lab exercises, and a standardized template for workshop."
